The purpose of the application is to read in three files, each seperated by a different delimeter (',', ' ', '|').
These files contain a list of persons with their attributes and should be imported and then return a formatted string
in three different sorts.

Output 1 - sorted by gender (females before males) then by last name ascending
Output 2 - sorted by birth date, ascending then by last name ascending
Output 3 - sorted by last name, descending

The info should display in the following order: last name, first name, gender, date of birth, favorite color.
Display dates in the format M/D/YYYY.
